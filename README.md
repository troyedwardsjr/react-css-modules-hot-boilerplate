# react-css-modules-hot-boilerplate
A simple boilerplate for webpack + ES6 + react + redux + multi-reducer + react hot loader + css modules + SASS.

Made for my own projects, containing the scaffolding for everything I currently need in a react boilerplate. A forked project of webpack-react-redux.

Contains: 

* Webpack
* Babel (ES6)
* React
* React-Router
* React-MD (Great React material design UI library with no inline styles and compatible with older browsers.)
* Redux
* Redux Dev Tools
* Redux thunk
* Redux Promise
* Multireducer (Ducks, great for avoiding repeat reducers for providing the same function.)
* React Hot Loader
* Sass

## How to get started

0. ```npm install```
0. ```npm start```

Once running, if you want to hide the redux dev monitor: ```CTRL+H```

## Build the app
```npm run build```

This will build the app into the "dist" directory in the root of the project. It contains the index.html along with the minified assets, ready for production.
